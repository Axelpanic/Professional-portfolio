  "detailOrQuote": "I am Alex Hickey and I will graduate from the University of Wisconsin Fullstack Development Bootcamp in May, 2023. After ten years in security management where I led armed teams licensed by the Department of Defense and bank conglomerates, I decided to formalize my education in what I had spent my free time doing - working to program and refactor code. I initially taught myself how to program using linux and raspberry pi, leveraging pi-hole, PlexPi and ServerPi. In 2022, I wanted to expand my knowledge. My mom has more than 30 years of experience in software product management and UX design, and she suggested I enroll in bootcamp. I've spent the past eight months learning the fundamentals of front-end and backend development, as well as the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and the principles of Agile. I am seeking an entry-level position where I can continue to improve my skills and experience. "
