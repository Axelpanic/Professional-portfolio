  "detailOrQuote": "In 2022, I wanted to expand my knowledge. My mom has more than 30 years of experience in software product management and UX design, and she suggested I enroll in bootcamp.  I've spent the past eight months learning the fundamentals of front-end and backend development, as well as the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and the principles of Agile. I am seeking an entry-level position where I can continue to improve my skills and experience. "
